I stood this blog up several months ago and regrettably haven't been giving it very much attention, but it's time to change that! Today I am halfway through my week long SANS adventure in Orlando and it has inspired me to revisit this blog project of mine. As I mentioned in my ["Hello World"](https://bytehacks.com/2016-11-18-Hello-World/) post, teaching is one of the best ways to learn because it requires complete understanding of a subject, so as I study for the SEC503 GCIA Exam I will be writing several blog posts covering the exam topics. These posts will be released over the next few months, and I hope they will be enlightening for those who read them.

Enjoy!
