# Security Monitoring Checklist

I recently listened to Eric Conrad speak at SANS in Orlando, and many of the things he discussed have made me take a step back to re-evaluate the way we should be monitoring our organizations. Below is a checklist you can use to begin effectively monitoring your network with entirely free tools.

# Intelligently Store/Analyze Data:
- Centralized Log Storage:
  - [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/):
    - No limit on number of log sources
    - The stack is free and open source, but the [X-Pack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html) package is not. License by node
    - Fast
  - Also take a look at [SOF-ELK](https://github.com/philhagen/sof-elk), an attempt headed by Phil Hagen to distribute an ELK VM Appliance for security monitoring.
- Windoes Event Collector:

  - https://www.petri.com/configure-event-log-forwarding-windows-server-2012-r2
  - https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/centralizing-windows-logs/
- DeepBlueCLI - https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI

- Event Logging:
  - High-entropy service names are highly suspicious:
    - Service Name: MmvTBipnvXFMNFUs
    - Service File Name %SYSTEMROOT%\llTTAajm.exe
  - System Event ID 7045 - Service Creation
  - System Event ID 7030 - Service Creation Errors
  - Security Event 4720 "A user account was created"
  - Security Event 4732 ("A member was added to a security-enabled local group")
  - Security Event 4728 ("A member was added to a security-enabled global group")
  - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname='system';id=7045,7030}
  - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname="Security";id=4720,4732,4728}
  - Log Full Command Line of all Processes:
    - gpedit.msc: set the following variables:
      - Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policies\Detailed Tracking
      - Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Audit Process Creation
    - Get-WinEvent -FilterGashtable @{Logname="Security"; ID=4688}
    - List of abusive windows commands to monitor - http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/.s/2016/01/windows-commands-abused-by-attackers.html

  - Sysmon: Can be deployed to all endpoints for enhanced logging
    - [Config File Tuning](https://medium.com/@lennartkoopmann/explaining-and-adapting-tays-sysmon-configuration-27d9719a89a8)
    - Windows File Path: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx

- Whitelisting: Send these logs to centralized
  - AppLocker:
    - 8003: <exe or dll> was allowed to run but would have been prevented from running if AppLocker policy were enforced (audit mode)
    - 8004: <exe or dll> was not allowed to run (enforce mode)
    - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName="Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL"; ID=8003,8004}|OUT-Gridview

  - Active Mitigations: 
    - EMET BlockLogs:
      - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName="application"; ProviderName="EMET"; id=2}
    - CB Response Logs:
 

- Full Packet Capture + Network Security Monitoring Toolkit - Security Onion:
