Following are projects started by me. Check out my Github for more!

## GeoIP Attack Map
- Started: 2016
- GitHub: [GeoIP Attack Map](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/geoip-attack-map)

This geoip attack map visualizer was developed to display network attacks on your organization in real time. The data server follows a syslog file and parses out source IP, destination IP, source port, and destination port. Protocols are determined via common ports, and the visualizations vary in color based on protocol type.

## fTriage
- Started: 2018
- GitHub: [fTriage](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/fTriage)

Automating forensic artifact extraction, reduction, and analysis. fTriage leverages dozens of popular, open source tools to triage suspect memory/disk images. Each script automates a step in the investigation an analyst would otherwise perform manually. Moreover, I've written a wrapper to execute collections of data acquisition scripts. There is no limit to how many scripts you can run at once, but naturally there are some that need to be run before others, review the "Recommended Usage" section for example usage of prebuilt script lists.   
 
## rfBro
- Started: 2017
- GitHub: [rfBro](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/rfBro)

Security Onion / Bro / Recorded Future Intel integration script

## sostat-salt.sh
- Started: 2018
- GitHub: [sostat-salt](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/sostat-salt)

Script to run sostat across entire Security Onion cluster and then separate into individual text files.   

## ExchangeSnooper
- Started: 2017
- GitHub: [ExchangeSnooper](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/ExchangeSnooper)

Phishing emails often end up in user mailboxes; Incident responders should be able to easily remove them. This Powershell script accomplishes that task.

## Secure Boot MOK Scripts
- Started: 2017
- GitHub: [Secure Boot MOK Scripts](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/secure-boot-mok-scripts)

Set of scripts I wrote to simplify UEFI Secure Boot Machine Owner Key generation, and signing of Nvidia, VMware, and VirtualBox kernel modules. These MOKs can be used to sign other kernel modules as well.
