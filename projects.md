## GeoIP Attack Map
- Started: 2016
- GitHub: [GeoIP Attack Map](https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/geoip-attack-map)

This geoip attack map visualizer was developed to display network attacks on your organization in real time. The data server follows a syslog file and parses out source IP, destination IP, source port, and destination port. Protocols are determined via common ports, and the visualizations vary in color based on protocol type.
