My name is Matt May; I spend the majority of my time dabbling in security and open source. This page used to contain a long list of skills and various technologies I'm familiar with, but it was frustrating to maintain, and that's what resumes are for! Additionally, in the footer of this site I left links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.

This is a collection of notes, enjoy.
